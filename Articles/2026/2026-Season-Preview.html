        	After a strong finish to the 2025 season that ended in heartbreak, Trinity looks to come out strong for the 2026 season. They proved at the end of last season that they could beat anyone in their division, and possibly the middle division as well. They proved that by beating the eventual D2 champs Castlewood in the previous year. This offseason, manager and utility player Rafe O’Donnell along with assistant manager and pitcher Trent Beachem have been trying to recruit. There has been some interest from players in joining the Trinity softball team. Along with strong returning players such as Dave Martino, Brock Beachem, Cadin Helfrich, etc. they look to make some noise in the league this year. While teams like St Peters, the one seed in the playoffs from last year, and Bright Hope, the team who is moving down from the Middle Division, are the early favorites to win, there is no doubt that this team has the highest upside in the division. They are by far the youngest team in the entire league, with most of their players being high school or college kids. Their schedule includes playing St. Peters, Bright Hope, First Baptist, and a possible new team or a renewed Mt. Zion team. They will play some of these teams more than one night throughout the year as well. They will also play 2 of the following 5 teams: Victory 2, Westminster, North Main Street, St. Faustina, and ZHC. These are all D2 teams that Trinity will be looking forward to the opportunity to try and upset. Trinity is coming into this year with a determination to win. If this team could put it all together, it is very possible for them to win 15-16 games this year. A championship could be on the horizon for Trinity. One thing is for certain, you do not want to miss this team in action, they are going to be an exciting team to watch. Try to make it out to their games this year, they will all be worth watching.
