        After an underwhelming start in 2024 as a first year team, Trinity got a fresh start in the third division with a chance to get their footing.  Trinity got more players with talent along with their already developing young talent. Trinity finished the year with a 9-11 record, (8-8 Divisional Record). While still not what they are looking for, it showed big improvement. A highlight win for them was a 17-16 win over the eventual D2 champions Castlewood the first night of the season. It showed this team that they had the potential to win big games. After that, not much success followed. About halfway through the season they were 3-7. However, they always put up a fight in these games. They still had that spark. After the slow start, something started clicking, they finished the season going 6-4, (6-2 divisionally), and they were on a roll. Entering the first round of the playoffs, they were the favorite to win versus Mt. Zion. Trinity came out flat and ended up losing game 1. The team made some adjustments and made some strategic moods and ended up winning a high scoring Game 2, with a score of 26-21. The best of 3 series was coming to a dramatic conclusion with tensions high between the two teams. Both teams came out to play, unfortunately for Mt. Zion, Trinity was completely walked in. The dramatic conclusion ended not so dramatically as Trinity won 14-2 and only had to play 5 innings due to the league's 10-Run Rule. Trinity was moving on to the semi-finals. Once again in a best of 3 series, Trinity came out to play hard. St. Peters was the top seed remaining in the bracket. Unfortunately for Trinity, they only had 9 banged up players who could play. Despite that, Trinity put up a strong fight. They hung in the first game for as long as they could but ended up losing by 6 runs. The second game the team knew that it was do or die. They came out playing hard. They were winning a close 12-11 game going into the top of the 7th. Despite Trinity's efforts, they gave up 2 runs to St. Peters, and went into the bottom of the 7th losing 13-12. They got a few baserunners, but could not overcome the top seed. Trinity's season was over. Trinity looks to improve even more and build off of a strong finish from 2025. They go into 2026 with a chip on their shoulder, and a team who could do a lot of damage.
